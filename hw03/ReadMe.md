The solution to the temperature problem is within temp.py. It enables both 
temperature sensors, and once one exceeds the listed tmpHigh, it outputs
it's temperature in Fahrenheit. 

The base code for temperature can also be found within tempShell, which merely 
outputs the Fahrenheit value of both temperature sensors 

The solution to the 8x8 etch a sketch is in sketcherLED.py. This program 
sets up an 8x8 grid, output to the LED, which works as an etch-a-skethc. User 
can either use the wsad keys to move the light, or the four push buttons wired
into the GPIO. The board may be cleared with either the c character or the puase
button. The program may be exited with either the x character or the MOD button.
