The solution to the temperature problem is within temp.py. It enables both 
temperature sensors, and once one exceeds the listed tmpHigh, it outputs
it's temperature in faherheight. 

The solution to the 8x8 etch a sketch is in sketcherLED.py, whcih accepts 
inputs from the GPIO_0 and the wsad keys.
